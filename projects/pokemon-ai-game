problem: "Demonstrate AI capabilities in automation to third-party through an engaging, gamified example"

solution: "Built a Pokédex where users submit Pokémon images, analyzed via OpenAI Vision, and dynamically generate Pokédex entries using Text Gen.
Tines orchestrates automation, and a custom ML model recommends Pokémon to catch based on typing and strength."

impact: "Award-winning finish. Strengthened AI engineering skills, exposed to model training, automated workflows, and API integrations.
Provided a fully interactive, scalable system including recommendations."

takeaways: "Experience designing end-to-end AI-powered automation systems, integrating generative AI, and building recommendation engines.
Reinforced full-stack engineering and ML deployment skills."

High-level breakdown:

- Users submit Pokémon images → analyzed by OpenAI Vision.
- Vision output structured → fed to Text Gen for Pokédex description.
- Tines orchestrates automation, maintains structured database, Python scripts help backend processing.
- Recommendation engine trained on Pokémon data, deployed via AWS Lambda.
- Interactive system allows team/party building, scalable and extendable for future features like battles.
